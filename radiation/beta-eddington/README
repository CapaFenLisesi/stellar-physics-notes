Making a series of related runs

Here we are making a series of runs in which we are only changing one
parameter, namely the mass. Rather than create separate project, we'll set up
one project, but direct the output to different directories.

The 'mk' script creates directories "ZAMS_*M", where * is 1, 3, 10, or 30.
Within each "ZAMS_*M" directory, it then creates "LOGS", "photos", and
"frames" directories to hold the output.

We then have 4 inlists, "inlist_*M", which direct the output via lines

photo_directory = 'ZAMS_1M/photos'
log_directory = 'ZAMS_1M/LOGS'

in &controls, and

Grid1_file_dir = 'ZAMS_1M/frames'
Profile_Panels1_file_dir = 'ZAMS_1M/frames'

in &pgstar.  The mass is set in &controls,
initial_mass = 1.0        ! edit this for each star

The scripts 'rn' and 're' have been modified and require an additional
argument, which is the mass of the star. Thus,

'./rn 3'

will perform the run for a 3 solar mass star. It does this by copying the file
"inlist_3M" to "inlist" and running ./star. The './re' command takes the mass
and the photo name, as before.

I encourage you to look at the scripts!

Working with mesa/star

Make as many copies of this work directory as you'd like, name them
anything, and put them wherever you'd like.  It is a good idea
to keep your work directories outside of the mesa directory tree.
That will make your life better when you do a fresh checkout of a 
new mesa version at some point in the future.

Edit the 'inlist' file in work to redirect to read 'inlist_project'.
There are 3 places where you need to have the filename of the inlist:
      extra_star_job_inlist1_name = 'inlist_project'
      extra_controls_inlist1_name = 'inlist_project'
      extra_pgstar_inlist1_name = 'inlist_project'

You might want to rename 'inlist_project' to something more appropriate,
such as 'inlist_co_wd' or 'inlist_hot_jupiter' -- if you do, then
change the names in 'inlist' to match.

Make your work version of star by executing the 'mk' script.

   ./mk

   First, it compiles 3 files, placing output in your make directory:
   
      src/run_star_extras.f
      <MESA_DIR>/star/job/run_star.f
      src/run.f
   
   Then it links a lot of things to make your 'star' program.

Start your copy of mesa star by running the 'rn' script.

Remove the objects and the star program by running 'clean'.

Change parameters for star by editing inlist_project.
The full set of parameters and default values can be found in
the star/defaults directory -- see

	controls.defaults
	history_columns.list
	pgstar.defaults
	profile_columns.list
	star_job.defaults
   
If you'd like to call your program something other than 'star',
add a line at the top of your makefile defining the variable STAR.
E.g., add a line like this before the "include" line.
STAR = star_co_wd
Then the make will name the executable 'star_co_wd.
You'll need to edit your 'rn' and 're' scripts to match the new name.
