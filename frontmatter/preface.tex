\section*{Preface}
These notes were written while teaching a graduate-level astronomy course, ``Stellar Astrophysics'' at Michigan State University during Spring Semesters 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014.  Additional notes were incorporated from a course on Nuclear Astrophysics during Spring Semester 2011. I am deeply indebted to the students in those courses for their questions, feedback, and patience.

Some of the material was inspired by three courses at UC-Berkeley in the mid-90's: ``Stars with Lars'', taught by Professor L. Bildsten; Statistical Physics, taught by Professor E.~Commins, and Stellar Fluid Mechanics, taught by Professor J. Graham.

The notes include exercises using the \mesa\ stellar evolution code, available from \url{http://mesa.sourceforge.net/}.  The exercises are prefaced with the symbol \raisebox{-0.015ex}{\includegraphics[height=1.4ex]{mesa_logo2}}.

These notes are under continuous revision; to refer to a specific version of the notes, please use the eight-character stamp labeled ``git version'' on the front page.
