\section*{Preface}
These notes were written while teaching a graduate-level astronomy course on stars at Michigan State University.  The only background preparation for this course is undergraduate physics and a course on radiative processes, and so portions of these notes could be useful for upper-level undergraduates.  
The text layout uses the \code{tufte-book} (\url{https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/}) \LaTeX\ class:  the main feature is a large right margin in which the students can take notes; this margin also holds small figures and sidenotes. Exercises are embedded throughout the text.  These range from ``reading exercises'' to longer, more challenging problems.  In addition, there are several numerical exercises that use the \mesa\ stellar evolution code, available from \url{http://mesa.sourceforge.net/}.  These numerical exercises are prefaced with the logo \raisebox{-0.015ex}{\includegraphics[height=1.4ex]{mesa_logo2}}, provided by kind permission of the MESA council.

These notes are under continuous revision; to refer to a specific version of the notes, please use the eight-character stamp labeled ``git version'' on the copyright page.

Some of the material was inspired by three courses at UC-Berkeley in the mid-90's: ``Stars with Lars'', taught by Professor L. Bildsten; Statistical Physics, taught by Professor E.~Commins, and Fluid Mechanics, taught by Professor J. Graham.  I am also indebted to the students who took the MSU stellar physics course for their questions, feedback, and encouragement. Additional thanks go to MSU graduate students Dana Koeppe and Wei Jia Ong for reading late stages of the drafts and testing the numerical exercises.
