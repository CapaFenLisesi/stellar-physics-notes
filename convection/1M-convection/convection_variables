! this file adds some extra columns to the profile datafiles
! in the inlist section star_job, set profile_columns_file = 'convection_variables' to use this file.

! units are cgs unless otherwise noted.

! reorder the following names as desired to reorder columns.
! comment out the name to omit a column (fewer columns => less IO => faster running).
! remove '!' to restore a column.

! note: you can include another list by doing
!        include 'filename'
!        include '' means include the default standard list file


! the following lines of the profile contain info for 1 zone per row, surface to center.

! first we'll include the standard set of lines
include ''

! now we'll include the difference between the adiabatic gradient 
! and the temperature gradient in the star
grada_sub_gradT

! and then the Brunt frequency, scaled to a dimensionless number
brunt_N2_dimensionless ! N2 in units of 3GM/R^3
