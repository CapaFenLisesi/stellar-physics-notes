The sun is very opaque.  Were photons able to stream freely, they would exit in $\sim \Rsun/c = 2.0\nsp\second$.  We saw that is instead takes millions of years for the sun to radiate away its stored thermal energy (see eq.~[\ref{e.K-H}]).  As a result, we can regard the sun as a cavity filled with photons with a very slight leakage.  This is the description commonly invoked to describe blackbody radiation, and we expect that in the interior of the sun, the radiation can be described by a photon gas in thermal equilibrium at the ambient temperature.

\section{Description of the Radiation Field}

Consider a cavity containing a gas of photons. In general we can describe the mean number of photons in this cavity as
\begin{equation}\label{e.photon-occupation} N = \frac{2}{h^{3}}\int f(p,x)\,\dif^{3}x\,\dif^{3}p.\end{equation}
Here $f$ is a distribution function; if we are in thermal equilibrium, $f$ is the Bose-Einstein distribution, but our discussion will be more general.  Now consider a small surface on our cavity with area $\dif A$ and unit normal $\unitn$.  The energy incident on this area in a time $\dif t$ having propagation vector along $\unitn$ and propagating into solid angle $\dif\Omega$ is found by integrating equation~(\ref{e.photon-occupation}) over a volume $c\dif t\,\dif A$,
\[
\dif E = \dif A\,c\dif t\,\dif\nu\,\left( \frac{2}{h^{3}}p^{2}\dif p\,\dif\Omega\right)  h\nu \, f.
\]
Since the photon momentum is $p = h\nu/c$, we have
\begin{equation}\label{e.specific-intensity}I_{\nu} \equiv \frac{\dif E}{\dif t\,\dif A\,\dif\Omega\,\dif\nu} = \frac{2h\nu^{3}}{c^{2}} f.\end{equation}
This defines the \emph{specific intensity} $I_{\nu}$.  It is easy to show that in the absence of interactions with matter, $I_{\nu}$ is conserved along a ray.  If the photons are in thermal equilibrium, then we can replace $f$ with the Bose-Einstein distribution,
\begin{equation}\label{e.Bnu}B_{\nu} \equiv \frac{2 h\nu^{3}}{c^{2}} \left[\exp\left(\frac{h\nu}{\kB T}\right)-1\right]^{-1}.\end{equation}Here $B_{\nu}$ is the \emph{Planck function}.

The energy density per frequency $u_{\nu}$ can be defined as $\dif E/(c \dif t\,\dif A\,\dif\nu)$; comparing this with the definition of $I_{\nu}$, we see that (for a blackbody)
\begin{equation}\label{e.radiation-energy-density}u_{\nu} = \frac{1}{c}\int I_{\nu}\,\dif\Omega = \frac{8\pi h\nu^{3}}{c^{3}}\left[\exp\left(\frac{h\nu}{\kB T}\right)-1\right]^{-1}.\end{equation}The total energy density can be found by integrating over all frequencies, giving
\[ u = \left[\frac{8\pi^{5}\kB^{4}}{15 h^{3}c^{3}}\right] T^{4}\equiv aT^{4} \]
in agreement with statistical mechanics.

The next quantity to define is the \emph{flux} of energy per unit time, with direction $\unitk$ crossing area $\dif A$ with unit normal $\unitn$, into solid angle $\dif\Omega$, and per frequency interval $\dif\nu$,
\begin{equation}\label{e.radiation-flux}F_{\nu} = \int I_{\nu} (\unitn\cdot\unitk)\,\dif\Omega.\end{equation}
If we take our polar angle with respect to $\unitk$, then $(\unitn\cdot\unitk)\,\dif\Omega = \cos\theta\,\sin\theta\,\dif\theta\,\dif \phi$; defining the direction cosine $\mu = \cos\theta$, this becomes 
\[ (\unitn\cdot\unitk)\,\dif\Omega = 2\pi \mu\,\dif\mu, \]
and for blackbody radiation
\[ F = \pi B_{\nu}.\]
If we integrate this over all frequencies, we recover the result,
\[ F = \left(\frac{ac}{4}\right) T^{4} = \sigma_{\mathrm{SB}} T^{4}, \]
where $\sigma_{\mathrm{SB}}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

\section{Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If we regard the sun as a large cavity filled with photons, estimate the total energy stored in the radiation field.  If the sun were to suddenly become completely transparent, what would be the resulting luminosity?
