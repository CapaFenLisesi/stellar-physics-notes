Consider an atmosphere (planar geometry) with constant gravity $\bvec{g} = -g \bvec{e}_{r}$ and a constant outward-directed flux $\bvec{F} = F\bvec{e}_{r}$. Let's assume that the gas can be described as a mixture of an ideal gas and radiation.  Further assume that the opacity is constant and grey (i.e., Thomson) and that the atmosphere is in LTE.

Under what conditions does the gas pressure dominate?
\begin{eqnarray}
\Pgas&\gg& \Prad\nonumber\\
\frac{\rho kT}{\mu \mb} &\gg& \frac{1}{3}aT^{4}\nonumber\\
\rho &\gg& 0.03\mu \left(\frac{T}{10^{7}\nsp\K}\right)^{3}\nsp\grampercc.
\end{eqnarray}
Note the magnitude; this is easily satisfied for stars like the sun.  Now consider the equation for the flux,
\begin{equation}
F = -\frac{1}{3}\frac{ac}{\rho\kappa}\frac{\dif T^{4}}{\dif r}.
\end{equation}
Let's rewrite this using the identity $\dif/\dif r = (\dif P/\dif r)(\dif/\dif P) = -\rho g (\dif/\dif P)$ as
\begin{equation}\label{e.F}
F = -\frac{c}{\rho\kappa}\frac{\dif \Prad}{\dif r} = \frac{cg}{\kappa}\frac{\dif \Prad}{\dif P}.
\end{equation}
It is critical to remember that $P$ is the \emph{total} pressure, $P = \Prad + \Pgas$. Now for something clever.  Since $F = L/(4\pi R^{2})$ and $g = GM/R^{2}$, we can cancel $R^{2}$ from both sides of equation~(\ref{e.F}). Further, recall that $4\pi GMc/\kappa = \Ledd$, the Eddington luminosity, so that we can write
\begin{equation}\label{e.Prad}
\frac{\dif \Prad}{\dif P} = \frac{L}{\Ledd}.
\end{equation}
Since $\dif \Prad/\dif P = 4 (\Prad/T) (\dif T/\dif P)$, we can work out immediately how $\dif T/\dif P$ changes with depth.

Since we are assuming an atmosphere with constant $L/\Ledd$, we can integrate equation~(\ref{e.Prad}) inward from the photosphere,
\begin{equation}
\Prad - P_{\mathrm{rad,0}} = \frac{L}{\Ledd}(P-P_{0}).
\end{equation}
Later on we will get the correct expression for the photospheric values (with subscript ``0''), but for now, let's go sufficiently deep that we can ignore the outer boundary, in which case,
\begin{equation}
\Prad \approx \frac{L}{\Ledd}P = \frac{L}{\Ledd}(\Pgas + \Prad).
\end{equation}
Dividing through by \Pgas, we obtain the desired result,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Prad}{\Pgas} = \frac{L}{\Ledd}\left(1-\frac{L}{\Ledd}\right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
The right-hand side is a constant; note that for the sun, $L/\Ledd \approx  3\times 10^{-5}$.
